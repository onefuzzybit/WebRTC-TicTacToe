# WebRTC-TicTacToe

This repo is a work-in-progress that aims to develop webRTC based game infrastructure - so that minimum server interaction would be needed. The goal is to be able to develop full peer 2 peer games easily.

In this stage of development, there's a single working game (tic-tac-toe) - only on localhost

The current state is partial implementation of milestone 1 of the project.
